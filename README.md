Hello! My name is Sundaram Sharma and I am currently in last semester of post-graduation at Conestoga college in the Mobile solutions development program. 

I term myself a "creative problem solver" because I like to solve problems with a creative approach. Throughout my program at Conestoga, I have learned and made projects on web development, mobile application development, software engineering, and more. I possess a good level of knowledge in UI design and Native Android development in Java as well as Kotlin. Meanwhile, I am continuously working on my ideas to fuel my imagination into reality. I am looking to start my journey as an Android developer where I can learn and apply my creativity.
